## About The Project

Discord is a great messaging application that has settled in our lives over time. We laugh, have fun and make friends on this platform. There are already countless Discord bots that offer us services such as moderation and mini-games.

However, as long as we are anonymous here and trust each other, **we share our troubles, problems and deepest feelings** on this platform.

**Well, have you ever seen a Discord bot that cares about your feelings and is eager to cheer you up?**

EgoistBot - contrary to its name - aims exactly that! **It detects your depressed mood** and sends you **uplifting EgeFitness quotes**. It also sends you many **exciting Fight Club quotes**, **thousands of inspirational quotes from important people in history**, and most importantly, **160 eye-opening Mustafa Kemal ATATÜRK quotes!**

## Built With



* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
